# HTTPure Basics

This guide is a brief overview of the basics of creating a HTTPure server.

## Creating a Server

To create a server, use `HTTPure.serve` (no SSL) or `HTTPure.serveSecure` (SSL).
Both of these functions take a port number, a router function, and an `Effect`
that will run once the server has booted. The signature of the router function
is:

```purescript
HTTPure.Request -> HTTPure.ResponseM
```

For more details on routing, see the [Routing guide](./Routing.md). For more
details on responses, see the [Responses guide](./Responses.md). The router can
be composed with middleware; for more details, see the [Middleware
guide](./Middleware.md).

## Non-SSL

You can create an HTTPure server without SSL using `HTTPure.serve`:

```purescript
main :: HTTPure.ServerM
main = HTTPure.serve 8080 router $ Console.log "Server up"
```

Most of the [examples](./Examples), besides [the SSL Example](./Examples/SSL),
use this method to create the server.

You can also create a server using a custom
[`HTTP.ListenOptions`](http://bit.ly/2G42rLd) value:

```purescript
main :: HTTPure.ServerM
main = HTTPure.serve' customOptions router $ Console.log "Server up"
```

## SSL

You can create an SSL-enabled HTTPure server using `HTTPure.serveSecure`, which
has the same signature as `HTTPure.serve` except that it additionally takes a
path to a cert file and a path to a key file after the port number:

```purescript
main :: HTTPure.ServerM
main =
  HTTPure.serveSecure 8080 "./Certificate.cer" "./Key.key" router $
    Console.log "Server up"
```

You can look at [the SSL Example](./Examples/SSL/Main.purs), which uses this
method to create the server.

You can also create a server using a
[`HTTP.ListenOptions`](http://bit.ly/2G42rLd) and a
[`HTTPS.SSLOptions`](http://bit.ly/2G3Aljr):

```purescript
main :: HTTPure.ServerM
main =
  HTTPure.serveSecure' customSSLOptions customOptions router $
    Console.log "Server up"
```
