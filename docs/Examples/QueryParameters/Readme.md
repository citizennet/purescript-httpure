# Query Parameters Example

This is a basic example that demonstrates working with URL query parameters. It
includes an example of routing based on the _existence_ of a query parameter, an
example of routing based on the _value_ of a given query parameter, and an
example where the response is driven by the contents of a query parameter.

To run the example server, run:

```bash
make example EXAMPLE=QueryParameters
```
