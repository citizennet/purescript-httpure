-- | The `Path` type is just sugar for an `Array` of `String` segments that are
-- | sent in a request and indicates the path of the resource being requested.
-- | Note that this type has an implementation of `Lookup` for `Int` keys
-- | defined by `lookupArray` in [Lookup.purs](./Lookup.purs) because
-- | `lookupArray` is defined for any `Array` of `Monoids`. So you can do
-- | something like `path !! 2` to get the path segment at index 2.
type Path = Array String

-- | Given an HTTP `Request` object, extract the `Path`.
