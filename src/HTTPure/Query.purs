-- | The `Query` type is a `Object` of `Strings`, with one entry per query
-- | parameter in the request. For any query parameters that don't have values
-- | (`/some/path?query` or `/some/path?query=`), the value in the `Object` for
-- | that parameter will be the an empty string. Note that this type has an
-- | implementation of `Lookup` for `String` keys defined by `lookupObject` in
-- | [Lookup.purs](./Lookup.purs) because `lookupObject` is defined for any
-- | `Object` of `Monoids`. So you can do something like `query !! "foo"` to get
-- | the value of the query parameter "foo".
type Query = Object.Object String

-- | The `Map` of query segments in the given HTTP `Request`.
